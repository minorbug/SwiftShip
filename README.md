## Official UrbanAirship example, ported to Swift

Swift looks fun. I downloaded the guide from Apple when iOS 8 was announced, but I didn't have time to delve into the new language until now - I'm in the process of converting a complicated Titanium app into two simpler, native apps for iOS and Android. But before I decide to make the switch to Objective-C (and its many, many helpful resources on Github and StackExchange), I wanted to make sure I could port our UrbanAirship notification code over to Swift. I wasn't able to find any examples online, so I wanted to share my port of the official example provided by Urban Airship in their iOS library.

Thankfully, Urban Airship recently released the AirshipKit framework for iOS 8, which makes adding UrbanAirship functionality to your project basically a two-step process.

It's pretty straightforward, and I only ported the AppDelegate code (this is my first Swift app and I wanted to get this post out ASAP so I'll leave that exercise for later).
